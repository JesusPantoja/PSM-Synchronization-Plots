# PSM Synchronization supplementary plots

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with supplementary plots for the manuscript "Segmentation-clock synchronization in circular-lattice networks of embryonic presomitic-mesoderm cells," which has been submitted for publication to the special issue "Biochemical Problems, Mathematical Solutions", of the journal *Mathematics in Science and Industry*.

The notebook PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb presents plots of the order parameter ($R$) mean value, together with the corresponding error bars (denoting standard error), vs. connectivity  level for PSM-cell networks of three different sizes, but in which the vertices each vertex is connected to were randomly selected. The results are quite similar to those of symmetric circular lattices, thus demonstrating that a connectivity level equal or larger than 6 is necessary for synchronization, regardless of network symmetry.

Additionally the jupyter notebooks named 11CellVgamma_d.ipynb, 21CellVgamma_d.ipynb and 41CellVgamma_d.ipynb, show the plots when varying the maximum expression rate for delta protein (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> parameter). And we can see that the order parameter has a behavior similar as when the connectivity level is changed, although when increasing the parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> for a given level of conectivity the synchronization is favoured, we can appreciate that the most effect is when the connectivity level is increased.
