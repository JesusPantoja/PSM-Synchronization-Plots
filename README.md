# Plots
The differents jupyter notebooks show additional plots of paper Segmentation-clock synchronization in circular-lattice networks of embryonic presomitic-mesoderm cells.
The PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb notebook creates plots when the levels of connectivity of each cell are selected randomly. For instance in the results shown in the manuscrit for the network size of 11 cells, cell 1 with 2 levels of connectivity is connected with cells 10, 11, 2, 3, in every repetition of the simulation. The results shown by  PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb correspond to vary randomly the connection of the cells in each repetition. For example in one case for the same cell mentioned above could be connected with cells 4, 9, 2, 6 in one repetition and with cells 8, 3, 9, 7 for another. The results are quite similar by that we can see that the relevant feature is the quantity of levels of connectivity.
For another side the jupyter notebooks named 11CellVgamma_d.ipynb, 21CellVgamma_d.ipynb and 41CellVgamma_d.ipynb, shown the plots when varying the maximum expression rate for delta protein the $\gamma_d$ parameter .....
