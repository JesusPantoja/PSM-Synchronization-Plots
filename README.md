# PSM Synchronization supplementary plots

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with supplementary plots for the manuscript "Segmentation-clock synchronization in circular-lattice networks of embryonic presomitic-mesoderm cells," which has been submitted for publication to the special issue "Biochemical Problems, Mathematical Solutions", of the journal *Mathematics in Science and Industry*.

The notebook PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb presents plots of the order parameter ($R$) mean value, together with the corresponding error bars (denoting standard error), vs. connectivity  level for PSM-cell networks of three different sizes, but in which the vertices each vertex is connected to were randomly selected. The results are quite similar to those of symmetric circular lattices, thus demonstrating that a connectivity level equal or larger than 6 is necessary for synchronization, regardless of network symmetry.

Additionally the notebooks named 11CellVgamma_d.ipynb, 21CellVgamma_d.ipynb and 41CellVgamma_d.ipynb, show the results of varying the maximum expression rate protein delta (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> parameter). We can see that the order parameter has a similar behavior similar to that of changing the connectivity level. Although, when increasing parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> for a given level of conectivity the synchronization is favoured, the effect stronger is when the connectivity level is increased.
