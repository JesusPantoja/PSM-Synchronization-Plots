# Plots
The jupyter notebooks show supplemet plots.
The PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb notebook create plots for synchronization when the levels of connectivity of each cell are selected ramndomly. For example for the network size of 11 cells, cell 1 with 2 levels of connectivity is connected with cells 10, 11, 2,3 in every repetition of the simulation. And the results are shown in the manuscrit. The results shown by  PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb correspond to vary randomly the connection of the cells in each repetition. The results are quite similar by that we can see that the relevant feature is the quantity of levels of connectivity.
