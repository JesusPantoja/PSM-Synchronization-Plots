# Plots
The different jupyter notebooks show additional plots of paper Segmentation-clock synchronization in circular-lattice networks of embryonic presomitic-mesoderm cells.
The PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb juyter notebook shows plots when the levels of connectivity of each cell are selected randomly. For instance in the results shown in the manuscrit (Figure 4) for the network size of 11 cells, cell 1 with 2 levels of connectivity is connected with cells 10, 11, 2, 3, in every repetition of the simulation, and the plot shown by PlotSuppVCIR3d.ipynb is the result of changing the cell connectivity in each repetition. The results are quite similar by that we can see that the relevant feature is the quantity of levels of connectivity.

Additionally the jupyter notebooks named 11CellVgamma_d.ipynb, 21CellVgamma_d.ipynb and 41CellVgamma_d.ipynb, show the plots when varying the maximum expression rate for delta protein (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> parameter). And we can see that the order parameter has a behavior similar as when the connectivity level is changed, although increasing the parameter <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_d"> for a given level of conectivity the synchronization is favoured we can see that the most effect is when the connectivity level is increased.
